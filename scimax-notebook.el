;;; scimax-notebook.el ---    -*- lexical-binding: t -*-

;;; Commentary:
;; This is an experiment in using scimax and org-mode for scientific notebook
;; purposes. The idea is you have a "project" that is a set of org and other
;; files under version control (git). There is a "master" file that is the
;; starting point, e.g. the README.org file. You can use `projectile' to switch
;; between projects easily, or search/find files within a project.
;;
;; `nb-new' is command to create a new project, it is just a thin wrapper that
;; creates the directories, registers them with projectile, and opens the master
;; file.
;;
;; `nb-open' is a command to open an existing project. It is a thin wrapper
;; around the projectile-switch-project command that opens the master file.
;;
;; `nb-agenda' to see the TODO items within a project, or do other org-agenda
;; things within the scope of the project, e.g. search by tag/property.
;;
;; `nb-archive' creates a zip-archive of the project.
;;
;; Note there is a projectile hydra defined: `hydra-projectile/body' that may be
;; useful for scimax-notebooks.
